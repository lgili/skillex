# Python Pro

## Overview

Use this skill to deliver Python changes with clear architecture, explicit types,
high-signal tests, reproducible tooling, and measured performance decisions.

Default stance:

- Prefer boring, explicit Python over clever Python.
- Keep domain logic isolated from framework and I/O glue.
- Type public interfaces and boundary payloads.
- Add or update tests for every behavior change.
- Run quality gates before calling the work done.

## Core Workflow

1. Inspect the baseline and constraints.
   - Confirm Python version, runtime style, and deployment target.
   - Read `pyproject.toml`, lockfiles, CI workflow, and test tooling before changing structure.
   - Identify whether the repo is a library, CLI, API/service, worker, or data pipeline.

2. Choose the right shape for the code.
   - Library: stable public API, small modules, explicit exports.
   - CLI: argument parsing and terminal I/O at the edge, business logic in reusable functions.
   - API/service: transport code thin, request/response models explicit, domain rules framework-independent.
   - Worker/pipeline: idempotency, retries, observability, and checkpointing matter more than framework elegance.

3. Design contracts before implementation.
   - Type function signatures, DTOs, config, and error classes.
   - Use `dataclass`, `TypedDict`, `Protocol`, or Pydantic intentionally rather than ad hoc dicts.
   - Keep sync vs async boundaries explicit; do not mix both casually in one subsystem.

4. Implement with maintainability first.
   - Keep modules cohesive and dependency flow one-directional.
   - Use domain exceptions and actionable error messages.
   - Make external effects observable and testable.

5. Validate with the right depth.
   - Unit tests for pure logic, integration tests for boundaries, targeted regression tests for bug fixes.
   - Run `scripts/run_quality_gates.py` before final delivery.
   - For legacy repos, run `scripts/audit_python_project.py` first to map gaps and migration priorities.

6. Deliver safely.
   - Explain architecture changes, type decisions, and test coverage.
   - Call out migration risk for package layout, config, or dependency changes.
   - Prefer incremental refactors over wide rewrites when behavior is already in production.

## Bundled Scripts

- `scripts/bootstrap_python_project.py`
  - Scaffold a stronger Python baseline with `library`, `cli`, `api`, `worker`, or `pipeline` layouts.
  - Supports CI generation, optional pyright config, and cleaner defaults for `pyproject.toml`.
  - Use when starting a new project or standardizing a weak baseline.

- `scripts/run_quality_gates.py`
  - Run formatter, lint, typecheck, tests, optional coverage threshold, and optional security scan.
  - Auto-selects `mypy` or `pyright` when possible.
  - Use before final delivery or to mirror CI locally.

- `scripts/scaffold_test_template.py`
  - Generate `unit`, `integration`, `regression`, `async`, or `api-contract` pytest templates.
  - Use when you need fast, consistent coverage scaffolding without inventing structure every time.

- `scripts/audit_python_project.py`
  - Inspect an existing repository and report packaging, typing, testing, CI, and layout gaps.
  - Use at the start of large refactors or when inheriting a messy Python codebase.

## Constraints

### MUST DO

- Type all new or changed public interfaces.
- Keep domain rules isolated from framework, transport, and persistence code.
- Add or update tests for all behavior changes.
- Use explicit exception hierarchies and actionable failure messages.
- Prefer `pyproject.toml` as the source of truth for tooling and packaging.
- Explain architecture and migration tradeoffs when the change is non-trivial.

### MUST NOT DO

- Ship broad Python refactors without regression coverage.
- Use bare `except` or silent fallbacks to hide failures.
- Introduce global mutable state without lifecycle control.
- Mix sync and async code paths casually in the same service boundary.
- Add dependencies without a concrete operational or developer-productivity reason.
- Micro-optimize performance before measuring the bottleneck.

## When NOT to use this skill

Defer to a more specialized skill when the task is dominated by one of
these concerns:

- **Machine-learning model code (training loops, feature engineering,
  experiment design, evaluation)** → `senior-data-scientist`. Python-pro
  covers the language; the data-science skill covers the modelling
  workflow.
- **Data pipeline / ETL / orchestration (Airflow, Prefect, dbt, Spark,
  warehouse modelling)** → `senior-data-engineer`.
- **Security-first patterns (auth, secrets, input validation, dependency
  audits)** → `secure-defaults`.
- **Error-handling discipline (retries, circuit breakers, Result-style
  returns)** → `error-handling`. Python-pro covers typed exception
  hierarchies; `error-handling` covers the cross-cutting strategy.
- **Test design or coverage strategy** → `test-discipline`.
- **Code review of a PR** → `code-review`.
- **Commit message or PR description** → `commit-craft`.

## Output Template

For non-trivial Python tasks, provide:

1. Architecture summary.
2. Implementation details and typing decisions.
3. Test updates and scenario coverage.
4. Quality gates run or blocked.
5. Risk notes and migration follow-ups.
